    <string name="textview_title">Hello, and welcome to Blackjack, one player edition!</string>
    <string name="textview_rule">The rules are simple.
There are two players, one of which is the dealer AI. The other player is you! The goal
is to win through getting a count as close as possible to 21, without going over 21.
Suits don\'t affect the value of a card. Cards are worth the following: number cards
have the same value as their numbers. Jacks are worth 11. Queens are worth 12.
Kings are worth 13. Aces are worth 1. Each win
amounts to one point. The exception is a natural blackjack, where your opening hand
amounts to 21, and the dealer does not have a natural blackjack. In this case, you get
double the amount of points. Finally, there is hitting and standing. You may choose to
hit or stand so long as your cards add up to less than 21. When you hit, you draw a card.
When you stand, you choose to hold your cards and reveal your cards, the dealer does the same.
Think of standing like a duel button. At the end of the round, you may choose to either
quit the app, or start another round. Good luck, have fun!</string>
